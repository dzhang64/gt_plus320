OA System ReadMe
Overview
This OA (Office Automation) system is developed based on Java 7, the Spring Framework, and the MyBatis data persistence layer framework. The frontend utilizes JSP technology to construct the user interface. The system aims to enhance office efficiency, simplify daily office processes, and implement functionalities such as task management, document management, calendar scheduling, notifications, and announcements.

Technology Stack
Backend:
Java 7
Spring Framework
MyBatis
MySQL (or another database, depending on configuration)
Frontend:
JSP
HTML/CSS/JavaScript
jQuery (possibly for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests)
Build Tool:
None (Manual dependency management)
Server:
Apache Tomcat (or another Servlet-supported server)
Environment Setup
1. Development Environment
IDE: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or another IDE that supports Java development.
JDK: Java Development Kit 7 or a higher version.
Database: MySQL Server (or another compatible database).
Web Server: Apache Tomcat 7 or a higher version.
2. Manual Dependency Management
Since Maven is not used, you will need to manually download and include the required JAR files for Spring, MyBatis, MySQL JDBC driver, and any other libraries your project depends on. Place these JAR files in a lib directory within your project's WEB-INF folder.


4. Deployment to Tomcat
Package the Project: Manually compile your Java classes and package them into a WAR file. Alternatively, you can use an IDE's built-in tools to create a WAR file.
Deploy the WAR File: Place the generated WAR file in the webapps directory of your Tomcat server.
Start the Tomcat Server: Access http://localhost:8080/your-war-file-name to view the system.
Usage
After successful deployment, navigate to the system's homepage using the URL provided by Tomcat.
Log in using the credentials provided or set up during the initial database population.
Explore the system's features, such as creating tasks, uploading documents, scheduling events, and viewing notifications.
Notes
Ensure that your Tomcat server and MySQL database are running before attempting to deploy and access the OA system.
Customize the system according to your organization's needs by modifying the database schema, Spring configuration, and JSP pages.
Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.
This ReadMe file provides a basic overview of setting up and using the OA system. For more detailed instructions or troubleshooting, refer to the project's documentation or contact the developers.
